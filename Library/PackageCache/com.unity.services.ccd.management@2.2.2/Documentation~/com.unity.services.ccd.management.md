CCD Management comes with a simple usage sample to help you get started out of the box. 

To import the CCD Sample Window:

1. Open the `Package Manager` window within Unity
2. Navigate to the `com.unity.services.ccd.management` and click `Import` on the **CCD Sample Window**.

This will add a **Samples** folder to your project. Navigate to `Window > CCD Sample Window` and click `Begin CCD Sample Demonstration`. The script will run a demo of several workflows that can be used to manage CCD.
